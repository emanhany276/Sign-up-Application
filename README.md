# Project Overview
This project is a simple console-based C++ application designed for managing records of individuals. Users can add new records with details like name and age, and fetch these records using a unique ID assigned at the time of creation. The application is aimed at demonstrating fundamental concepts of classes, arrays, and basic I/O operations in C++.
